        Keeping this in mind the beauty of DevOps seems to be that this presumption
        is actually written into its philosophy unlike so many other proposed work structures.
        Because of this the use of the cloud is central to the development of coding projects
        that plan on using the DevOps archetype, its accessiblity and ease of sharing make it 
        an incredibly powerful tool in developing programs that are dynamic rather than static.
        Another key to maintaining this flexibility is breaking down the barriers between
        different pillars of a project. Sure, they recommend these teams being established and
        maintained throughout the duration of the project, but what allows DevOps to go above and
        beyond is that is also expected that these teams stay in communication with eachother so that
        instead of turtles all the way down there is a sort of lateral movement that is granted.

        DevOps in my opinion is set aside from other devlopment archetypes by another uniquity it 
        posses; innovation is part of the plan. It would appear as if this is in fact one of the main 
        reasons there is such a focus on flexibility in DevOps and its because often innovation and 
        a flexible environment go hand in hand. DevOps specifically hopes to nurture an environment 
        in which people are willing to try new things and more importantly they are allowed to fail along
        the way. A workspace like this is a tall order for many however and this is not to be taken for 
        granted. IBM themselves even mentions that while DevOps is being implemented in countless startup 
        companies successfully, to implement it in a corporation is a serious undertaking and is easier said
        than done. Make no mistake, plans that account for the future are usually the best and
        DevOps has the future in its sights at all times.
