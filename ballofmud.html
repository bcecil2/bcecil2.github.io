<h1 header>The Big Ball of Mud</h1>

<pre>
The big ball of mud is a great take on the dichotomy that seems inherent in 
the architecture of any decent sized computer projects. Our better halves always
drive us to build that project thats adorned with bells and whistles and comes with
a chrome finish, in fact it is often this kind of idealistic thinking that births 
great innovation. The biggest issue is sometimes this starry eyed wanderlust of constanly
perfecting leads to stagnantion in a project rather than growth. Many a great idea have 
yet to see the light of day because of this problem, and it is exactly because of this 
that our big ball of mud comes rolling into the picture.

This ball is just like it sounds its ugly, messy, constantly making messes but for all its
faults it has one thing our architecture plans dont. It works, its tangible, you can play with
it prod at it push it to its limits. These things are what make balls of mud almost invaluable in
a odd way. They work and not only that they can be tested and improved upon which is an
immensley valuable thing. What good is a product if its architecture is so rigid it cant change
in order to meet the end users often dynamic needs. Big balls of mud might be a mess to sift through
they might be full of garbage and loosley held together but one thing holds true
