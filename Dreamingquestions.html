   <br>  
</body>
     <h2>Chapter 0</h2>
     <hr>
     <pre>
     1.	Who wrote “software is hard?” Who is that guy? 
     <br>
     Donald Knuth wrote the quote and is well known in field of programming for writing several programming textbooks.
     <br>
     2.	Programmers start counting at what number? 
     <br>
     Programmers start counting at the number Zero because the machines they use to work i.e computers, start counting at this number too.
    <br>
      3. What was the original sense of a “hacker?”
      <br>
      Before hacking was thrown into the mainstream it was more analogous to someone who was a fanatic
     and would endlessly tweak their software and hardware in a quest for optimization.
     <br>
    4. According to a 2002 NIST study what % of software came in significantly late, over budget, or was canceled? 
    <br>
    Two out of three projects fell into this dismal category
    <br>
     5.	Who wrote the 1987 essay entitled “No Silver Bullet?”
     <br>
     Frederick P. Brooks, Jr wrote the essay.

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <br>
      <hr>
     <pre>
      1.	What roles in the Chandler project did Michael Toy, John Anderson, Ted Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, and Lou Montulli hold. 
     <br>
     2.	What is “Bugzilla?” 
     <br>
     Bugzilla is a tool that is used to help with the organization of large computer projects
     in this case it is being used to compile all the bugs in chandler and organize which ones have been taken care of
     and an time estimate for how long it will take to do so.
     <br>
     3.	What is OSAF?  
     <br>
     OSAF stands for the Open Source Applications Foundation.
     <br>
     4.	What is the projects name? 
     <br>
     The projects name is chandler.
     <br>
     5.	What will the software do? 
     <br>
     The end goal is for chandler to become a Personal Information Manager (PIM)
     <br>
     6.	What is Toy’s keyword for “black hole” bugs? 
     <br>
     :Scary.
     <br>
     7.	What scared Toy so much about Bug 44? 
     <br>
     Toy was scared by the fact that it is impossible to know the amount of time it will take to fix these kinds of bugs.
     <br>
     8.	What did Toy refer to as a “snake?” 
     <br>
     a snake refers to a problem of which there is no consensus on the best way to deal with said problem.
     <br>
     9.	In the software world, what does “slippage” mean?
     <br>
     In the software world projects become late so frequently that “slippage” has become
     a friendly euphemism when referring to a project that is experiencing setbacks to its schedule.
     <br>
      10.	Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project? 
      <br>
      Brooks was programing manager for the IBM system/360
     <br>
      11.	What is Brooks's Law? 
      <br>
      Brooks law went as such: “adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
     <br>
      12.	Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code? 
      <br>
      Brooks found that 1/6th of the time was spent writing code about 16%.
     <br>
    13.	Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?
    <br>  
    Brooks found that the amount of time testing and fixing bugs made up about 50% of the programmers schedule.
    <br>
    14.	Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied under what conditions? 
    <br> 
    When a task can be split up amongst many workers with no communication required between them.
     <br>
    15.	What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?
    <br>
    The source code has been written by a human whereas the progam your installing is translated into a syntax that is readable  for the computer.
     <br>
     16.	What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free” software advocates share? 
     <br>
     Software that anyone can tinker with is bound to improve over time in ways closed software can’t match.
     <br>
     17.	What is the difference between a “good” programmer and a “great” programmer? 
     <br>
     Good programmers know what to write, Great programmers know what to rewrite and reuse.
     <br>
     18.	Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.
     <br> 
     One of the central differences between the Cathedral and the bazaar is the formers sense of mysticism that seems to be intertwined with closed source programs.
     Raymonds use of wizards is far from an arbitrary choice of words but rather an apt portrayal of the guild like attitude of closed source.
     Projects seemed to be built by many groups of few people each pundits but only in their specialized subsection of programming. 
     In the stark contrast the bazaar ideology is just as it sounds bustling,full of trade and constantly shifting to meet demands. 
     Where Cathedrals were not open until finished the bazaar offered constant betas and in doing so opened up the doors for constructive criticism and insight to mass amounts of people, 
     while cathedrals stayed closed shut till opening day marinating, and offering little to no room for outsider input.
       <br>
       19.	Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns?
       <br>
       The way it is portrayed in the reading it certainly seems as if open source has at least begun to chip away at the previously impenetrable wall.
       The relatively recent uptick in accessibility that the internet as a whole has seen appears to have helped with the central issue.
       With information at anyones fingertips and the only roadblock appear to be ones motivation the issue of equipping people with the knowledge they need to handle a problem seems to be fading exponentially.
        <br>
    20.	What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled?
    <br>
    Andy encouraged them to “stop designing and start coding” he encouraged them to start writing a basic structure and
    let the feeling of progress revitalize them into moving the project as a whole out of its stagnant stage.

     <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
     <br>
     <hr>
     <pre>
     1.	What was the lifetime as a supported product, of Lotus 123? When did Kapor walk away from it? Why did he walk away from it?
     <br>
     Kapor resigned from lotus in 1986 this choice ultimatley came down to a issue of personal happiness
      Kapor was neither a buisness or a programmer at heart so despite his buisnesses success he ultimatley felt unfullfilled.
      <br>
     2.	What does it mean for a program to “fork?” 
     <br>
     A fork would typically occur in an open source program where people disagreed on the best route of solving a given issue.
     <br>
     3.	Linus Torvalds used a “science” and “witchcraft” analogy referring to software, explain.
     <br>
     Linus Torvalds makes a great observation in the parallels of the scientific community and the witch craft community
     in respect to open and closed source code. Much like the field of science in open source peer review and communication is the standard
     leading to a vast community of contributors. In contrast closed programs are closely guarded much like the witches spells.
      <br>
    4.	Who, where, when demonstrated one of the first PIM software programs? 
    <br>
    Douglas Engelbart unveiled the oNline System to the public at the San Francisco convention center in 1968.
        <br>
    5.	People often refer to starting their computer as “booting” their computer. What was the origin of this term?
    <br> 
    It originatd from the term bootstrapping and the implementation of a bootstrap loader which loaded thee computer with just enough information to load the OS into its memory.
         <br>
    6.	Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed?
    <br>    
    The GUI was developed at Xeroxes Palo alto research center.
          <br>
      7.	List three software project “train wrecks.”
      <br>
      The FBI’s Trilogy project, Mcdonalds Innovate, and Fords Everest system
       <br>
       8.	What software crisis? Scan this article, what does it suggest? <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-non-existent-software-crisis-debunki/240165910">Article</a>
       <br>
       The article lays out some interesting infographics geared towards portraying systems of developing products and their efficacy,
       however its key point seems to be on the second page and is a call to action. It poses an important question;
       perhaps creating the narrative of a market in crisis is actually in the software industries favor.
      
     
     <br>
     9.	Scan down this article to the two conclusions (about eight paragraphs down). With two sentences, what is your take away from this?<a href="http://scribblethink.org/Work/Softestim/softestim.html">Article</a>
     <br>
     Software consultants can often sell false promises. Software creation is just that “creative” and therefore the production of it is highly subjective to who is working on it.
      
     
    </pre>
     <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
     <hr>
   <pre>
     1.	Keep track of team members: 2001 --> Mitch Kapor, Morgen Sagen, Al Cho, Andy Hertzfeld
    
     2.	When introducing a new technology or design, why did Frederick Brooks advise “plan to throw one away?”
      
    Brooks suggested planning to throw at least one away because you will almost always fail the first time
    and you can either factor this reality in or deliver a faulty product.
     
      3. 2002, Katie Parlante joined Chandler. When she first joined what did she do? 
      
      She was mostly doing product research such as researching user patterns logging common bugs
       and complaints with the calendar software and brainstorming ways that a PIM could circumvent annoying games of phone tag.
      
     4. John Anderson joined Chandler as “systems architect.” Briefly, what did that mean? 
     
     Anderson was in many ways a project manager, his primary function was deciding the ways to tackle issues;
     more aplty put he would chose the right tools for the job.
     
     5.	What is a “core” dump? Why the use of the word core?
     
     A core dump was a report sent to the user when a fatal error occurs that contain the contents of its memory at the time of failure.
     The use of the word core stems from the earliest memory banks, which in the 60's were built from wound wire coils
      and were called Ferrite cores although they soon became obsolete the core stuck around.
     
     6.	How did Erik Sink, speaking of abstractions, describe what programmers do?
     
     He described the program process as building upon old layers through abstraction.
     Building upon specific and sometimes archaic code to put it into a more generalzied and malleable form.
     
     7.	Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110  1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand language called what? 
     
     Assembly Language.
     
     8.	Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created: Lisp, Cobol, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the first widely used. What kind of program converted Fortran to binary? 
     
     The program used to convert Fortran back to computer friendly binary was called a Compiler.
     
     9.	What are the implications behind: “...there is no Moore’s Law for software. 
     
     Chips may double in capacity every year or two; our brains don’t.”? 
     The attempts to make something perform above and beyond or to optimize it for the current hardware are futile 
     as the landscape is constantly shifting and making attempts at optimazation seem hardly worth the time. 
     It also points to the idea that the machines will be able to bear far greater loads than the humans working on them and this will only increase 
     making it all the more efficent to dump the heavy lifitng on the computer.
     
     10.	The language selected for Chandler was Python. What does it mean that Python was an interpreted language? 
     
     An interpreted language differs from a compiler method by being a two step proccess. 
     Interpreted languages are proccessed and then translated line by line into binary. 
     
     11.	The announcement of Chandler occurred when? (Interesting Paper) Slashdot page from 2002.
     
     Chandlers annuncement occured on October 20th 2002 on Dan Gillmor's Mercury news column.
     </pre>
    
     <pre>Chapter 4
     1. What do “front ends” and “back ends” mean to software developers? 
     
     The front end usually refers to the user interface
     where as the back end refers to the where the information that the user puts into the front is being taken
      they basically inform each other based on the user inputs.
     
      2. What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?
     
     The lego hypothesis refers to the idea of having pre made programs that can be easily
     put together in order to quickly build parts of a larger project.
     
     3. Give one reason why the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well.
    
     Programs arent designed with the intent of melding into other programs.
     Many programmers also took issue with simply using someone else's work because they thought they could write something better in the first place.
      </pre>
     <br>
    <pre>Chapter 5
     1. What is the three-way trade-off that many software projects struggle to overcome.
     
     The trade off is Fast Cheap Good pick any two but you cant have all of them.
     
     2. What is the more recent definition of “geek?”
     
     A more modern definition would be someone who has a unique capcity for concentration
     and applies it to even the most mundane tasks and derives joy from doing so.

     3. What does “refactoring” mean to programmers?
     
     Refactoring means rewriting a chunk of code to make it more concise and easier
     to read without changing its function.

     4. What is “yak-shaving?”
     
     Yak shaving is the solving of a seemingnly pointless problem which starts a chain of problem solving
     that allows you to solve the main problem.
    </pre>  
    <br>
    <pre>Chapter 6
    <hr>
    1.  What is term “edge cases” referring to in software development?
    
    Edge cases refer to uses who will do every weird thing that the software allows,
    and in doing so they usually trigger glitches or holes in the software.

    2.  Summarize briefly Linus Torvalds advice about “large projects” give in 2004

    Linus encourages starting "trivial". Build something simple that has immediate use.
    Then when all is going well with the project expand piece by piece.
    "If I had expected to do something that big, I never would have started."
