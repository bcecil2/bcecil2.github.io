     </body>
     Chapter 0
     1.	Who wrote “software is hard?” Who is that guy? 
     Donald Knuth wrote the quote and is well known in field of programming for writing several programming textbooks.
     <br>
     2.	Programmers start counting at what number? 
      Programmers start counting at the number Zero because the machines they use to work i.e computers, start counting at this number too.
    <br>
      3.What was the original sense of a “hacker?”
    Before hacking was thrown into the mainstream it was more analogous to someone who was a fanatic and would endlessly tweak their software and hardware in a quest for optimization.
     <br>
    4.	According to a 2002 NIST study what % of software came in significantly late, over budget, or was canceled? 
     Two out of three projects fell into this dismal category
    <br>

     2.	What is “Bugzilla?” 
     Bugzilla is a tool that is used to help with the organization of large computer projects in this case it is being used to compile all the bugs in chandler and organize which ones have been taken care of and an time estimate for how long it will take to do so.
     <br>
     3.	What is OSAF?  
     OSAF stands for the Open Source Applications Foundation.

     :Scary.
     <br>
     7.	What scared Toy so much about Bug 44? 
     Toy was scared by the fact that it is impossible to know the amount of time it will take to fix these kinds of bugs.
     <br>
     8.	What did Toy refer to as a “snake?” 
     a snake refers to a problem of which there is no consensus on the best way to deal with said problem.
     <br>
     9.	In the software world, what does “slippage” mean?
      In the software world projects become late so frequently that “slippage” has become a friendly euphemism when referring to a project that is experiencing setbacks to its schedule.
     <br>
      10.	Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project? 
      Brooks was programing manager for the IBM system/360
     <br>
      11.	What is Brooks's Law? 
      Brooks law went as such: “adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
     <br>
      12.	Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code? 
      Brooks found that 1/6th of the time was spent writing code about 16%.
     <br>
    13.	Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?
       Brooks found that the amount of time testing and fixing bugs made up about 50% of the programmers schedule.
    <br>
    14.	Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied under what conditions? 
       When a task can be split up amongst many workers with no communication required between them.
     <br>
    15.	What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?
     The source code has been written by a human whereas the progam your installing is translated into a syntax that is readable  for the computer.
     <br>
     16.	What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free” software advocates share? 
     Software that anyone can tinker with is bound to improve over time in ways closed software can’t match.
     <br>
     17.	What is the difference between a “good” programmer and a “great” programmer? 
     Good programmers know what to write, Great programmers know what to rewrite and reuse.
     <br>
     18.	Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.
       One of the central differences between the Cathedral and the bazaar is the formers sense of mysticism that seems to be intertwined with closed source programs. Raymonds use of wizards is far from an arbitrary choice of words but rather an apt portrayal of the guild like attitude of closed source. Projects seemed to be built by many groups of few people each pundits but only in their specialized subsection of programming. In the stark contrast the bazaar ideology is just as it sounds bustling,full of trade and constantly shifting to meet demands. Where Cathedrals were not open until finished the bazaar offered constant betas and in doing so opened up the doors for constructive criticism and insight to mass amounts of people, while cathedrals stayed closed shut till opening day marinating, and offering little to no room for outsider input.
       <br>
       19.	Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns?
        The way it is portrayed in the reading it certainly seems as if open source has at least begun to chip away at the previously impenetrable wall. The relatively recent uptick in accessibility that the internet as a whole has seen appears to have helped with the central issue. With information at anyones fingertips and the only roadblock appear to be ones motivation the issue of equipping people with the knowledge they need to handle a problem seems to be fading exponentially.
        <br>
    20.	What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled? Andy encouraged them to “stop designing and start coding” he encouraged them to start writing a basic structure and  let the feeling of progress revitalize them into moving the project as a whole out of its stagnant stage.
        
     Chapter 2
     1.	What was the lifetime as a supported product, of Lotus 123? When did Kapor walk away from it? Why did he walk away from it?
     2.	What does it mean for a program to “fork?” A fork would typically occur in an open source program where people disagreed on the best route of solving a given issue.
     3.	Linus Torvalds used a “science” and “witchcraft” analogy referring to software, explain. Linus Torvalds makes a great observation in the parallels of the scientific community and the witch craft community in respect to open and closed source code. Much like the field of science in open source peer review and communication is the standard leading to a vast community of contributors. In contrast closed programs are closely guarded much like the witches spells.
     4.	Who, where, when demonstrated one of the first PIM software programs? Douglas Engelbart unveiled the oNline System to the public at the San Francisco convention center in 1968.
     5.	People often refer to starting their computer as “booting” their computer. What was the origin of this term? It originatd from the term bootstrapping and the implementation of a bootstrap loader which loaded thee computer with just enough information to load the OS into its memory.
     6.	Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed? The GUI was developed at Xeroxes Palo alto research center.
     7.	List three software project “train wrecks.” The FBI’s Trilogy project, Mcdonalds Innovate, and Fords Everest system
     8.	What software crisis? Scan this article, what does it suggest?  The article lays out some interesting infographics geared towards portraying systems of developing products and their efficacy, however its key point seems to be on the second page and is a call to action. It poses an important question; perhaps creating the narrative of a market in crisis is actually in the software industries favor.

     9.	Scan down this article to the two conclusions (about eight paragraphs down). With two sentences, what is your take away from this? Software consultants can often sell false promises. Software creation is just that “creative” and therefore the production of it is highly subjective to who is working on it.
