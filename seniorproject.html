    <div class="text-justify">
	    The Oregon State Investment Group (OSIG) currently manages nearly $3.5 million spread across 3
	    different portfolios. However, unlike major finance firms, OSIG does not have access to 
	    the same advanced technology. Our work seeks to change that by using deep learning techniques
      to help the group analyze and manage their portfolios.
  
      <br>
      <br>

      As part of the machine learning team I developed software that recommends 
      an optimal allocation of assets for a portfolio. This gives managers additional insight
      into their portfolio, expedites the management process, and most importantly increases 
      returns!

    <h2 class="text-center">Results</h2>
    <div class="text-justify">
    We were able to implement a portfolio analysis model and generalized it to work
    on a variety of assets, something which the paper our initial research was based on did not do.
    We have seen great results running it on OSIG'S large cap portfolio,
    which contains around 20 assets each with a market cap above $10 million. Over a five year
    period our model is able to get around 1.9 cumulative return.

    <br>
    We also created a web application to be used by the group's portfolio analysts. For those interested in the details of the model read below or check

    <h2 class="text-center">Conclusions</h2>
    <div class="text-justify">
      The project gave very valuable applied deep learning experience. Our task was novel, giving me
      the opportunity to do challenging work like implementing our own loss
      function and validating its correctness. We also had to engineer the system end to end,
      which meant working with the  less glamorous aspects of machine learning like designing and curating a data pipeline, and validating and visualizing model results.

      For the model we are using a LSTM. It takes in a portfolio made up of \(n\) assets, we then
      collect some features for each asset (closing,volume,fundamentals etc.) and package these up
      into vectors. We then run them through a architecture that looks like this
      <br>
      <br>
        <img src=mode.gif class="bigcenter"></img>   
      <br>
      <br>
      In our case the hidden layer is an LSTM feeding into a fully connected layer, finally a softmax is used
      to make sure the weights of our portfolio sum to one. The whole network is driven by the
      sharpe ratio as a loss function, which tells us the amount of excess return our portfolio
      achieves relative to a risk free asset. For each asset we calculate the returns over a
      time period \(t\) and then compute the ratio of the mean returns to the volatility of the
      returns. Mathematically it looks like this

      \[
        \begin{align*}
          R_{p,t} &= \sum_{i=1}^n w_{i,t-1}r_{i,t}\\
          E(R_{p,t}) &= \frac{1}{T} \sum_{i=1}^T R_{p,t}\\
          L &= \frac{E(R_{p,t})}{\sqrt{\text{var}(E(R_{p,t}))}}\\
         \end{align*}
      \]
      
      <br>
      <br>
      This can be expresssed succinctly in pyTorch as
      <pre>
        <code>
           def sharpe_loss(weights, returns):
            # weights batch X time X assets
            # returns batch X time X assets

            #row wise dot product
            R = torch.sum(weights*returns,dim=-1)
            ER = torch.mean(R,1)
            STD = torch.std(R,1)
            ratio = torch.sum(ER/(STD+1e-6)) 
            return -ratio
        </code>
      </pre>
