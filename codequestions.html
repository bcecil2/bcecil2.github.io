<pre>Chapter 11
  1.Briefly describe the four gates explained in Chapter 11. 
  Describe the behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.

  There were 4 basic gates described in chapter 11 And,Or,Nor,Nand.
  The first gate And requires both switches to be closed for electrcity to flow freely.
  This could also be shown as a function where the output is always 0 if one of the inputs
  is 0 and only has a output of 1 if both inputs are 1.

  The Or gate only requires one switch to be closed for electrcity to flow.
  This can be shown by a function where the output is only 0 if both inputs are 0
  and always 1 as long as one input is 1.

  The gates become more complex beginning with the Nor gate.
  The Nor gate requires only one of the two switches to be closed for electrcity
  to flow but, both swtiches to be open for no electrcity to flow. This could also
  be shown by outputs where the output is only 1 if both inputs are 0 and always 0
  if one of the inputs is 1.

  The final gate is the Nand gate which is an inverse of the and gate.
  The Nand gate has electrcity flowing when either of the two switches are open
  and electricity ceases to flow only when both switches are closed. 
  The Nand gate is represented by outputs where it is only 0 if both inputs are one
  and is 1 as long as one of the inputs is 0.

 1. A half adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?

 The half adder is built from two sub components a XOR gate and an AND gate it has two inputs
 A and B and has two outputs a Sumout and a Carryout this means there are 2 bits of output.

 2. A full adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?

 A full adder is built from 2 half adders and an OR gate. So there are 5 sub components
 two XOR gates two AND gates and one OR gate. There are 3 inputs A,B, and Carryin there are two outputs Sumout and Carryout.
 
 3. How many total inputs and outputs are there for an 8-bit adding circuit?
 
 In an 8 bit adding ciruit there should be 16 inputs one for each of the 8 bit numbers
 being inputted. And there should be 9 outputs since adding two 8 bit numbers can produce a 
 nine bit number.
 
 4. How many total transistors are needed for the ripple version of the 8-bit adder?
 For the ripple version 144 transistors are needed to build the 8 bit adder.
