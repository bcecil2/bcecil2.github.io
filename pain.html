        To me the Berry's analysis read as a pragmatists interpretation
        of the past and current state of software development. I found it
        particularly interesting given that its thesis rested on the warnings
        of Fred Brooks showing that his concept of the silver bullet was so profound
        that it seems to still be an inescapable reality some decades later. And even
        more interesting that even with my totally novice programming expreince I find
        myself in almost all of the archetypes Berry lays out. It is inherently
        challeneging to resist skipping the planning stage in order to get to the more
        satisfying code pounding, it does seem that with every silver bullet shot at the 
        problem, it falls apart on impact creating a new host of injuries and issues. 
        However Berrys analysis of this seems perhaps less fatalistic than most, and while
        it is certainly easier said than done his proposal of applying objectivity and 
        rigor to the task of software devolpment seems to be the closest thing to a silver
        bullet.
