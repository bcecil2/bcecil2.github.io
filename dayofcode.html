    <h1>A Day of Code at OSU Cascades</h1>

    The day of code experince was fantastic and i walked away from it more excited than ever
    to continue my adventure into the discipline of computer science. Ive always sort of drifted 
    around from hobby to hobby and group to group most of my life never really settling in anywhere
    for too long. However going to the day of code event showed me that the computer science community
    is one i want want to be apart of. Its so unique in that it is filled with academic rigor but also
    complemented by a sort of recreationalist attitude that i really enjoyed. Beyond this the event was
    also in my opinion a perfect way for a novice like me to start thinking about the parts of code that 
    make it truly challeneging, such as write perfect code and writing code that tests your code for you.
    It really did a great job highlighting just how important and powerful these techniques are in taking
    your abilities beyond a novice level, while also keeping it light and fun. It was also awesome getting
    to see just how helpful it is working out loud with another person, you can really begin to see
    how everyone brings there own unique perspective and skill set to the table which is immensely helpful
    for getting over hurtles that would be much harder if done solo. Overall i loved the day of code and i 
    look forward to getting out there and participating with this wonderful community.
